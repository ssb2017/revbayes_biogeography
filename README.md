# revbayes_biogeography

This is the home page for the "Biogeography in RevBayes" workshop on Jan 8, 2017 at the SSB meeting in Baton Rouge.

## Overview

This workshop will cover the basics of the phylogenetic inference of historical biogeography. Topics include the dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis model, epoch models, joint inference of biogeography and phylogeny, process-based biogeographic dating, and multiclade hierarchical models.


## Tutorial and Resources

The biogeography tutorial pdf and resources will be uploaded prior to the workshop.


## Introductory Materials

This workshop will assume you have basic familiarity with RevBayes. If you were unable to attend the Jan 7th "Introduction to RevBayes" workshop, you are strongly advised to complete the following tutorials prior to the "Biogeography in RevBayes" workshop. (These are the same tutorials required for the Fossil & Molecular Analysis workshop.)

Basic Introduction to Rev and MCMC (tutorial pdf)
Introduction to MCMC Simulation (tutorial pdf)
Substitution Models for Time-Constrained Trees (tutorial pdf)
Partitioned Data Analysis (tutorial pdf)


## Required Software
